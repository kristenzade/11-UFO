# 11-UFO

## Overview of Project

The focus of this project was to create a webpage displaying data for NASA on UFO sightings, capable of taking user input for multiple fields to filter the data.

## Results
 
The refined webpage contains four additional filters to go along with the date filter. The additional fields include: City, State, Country and Shape.


## Summary

These additional search fields make this webpage more interactive. One drawback to these search fields is the lack of being case-insensitive specifically when two letter state codes are normally capitalized, and our data has them all lower-case. It would be beneficial to make all of the search fields where case doesnâ€™t matter.
